# Land Generation (Python)

This project generates a 2D land/terrain map using Python.  
It simulates elevation across a grid using randomized rules, producing areas that look like hills, mountains, and lowlands.

This was originally created as a class project to practice working with 2D lists (grids), randomization, and basic algorithm design.

## What this project does
- Creates a 2D grid representing land elevation
- Uses randomization to generate terrain-like patterns
- Outputs a map (numbers or symbols) that shows different elevation levels

## What I learned
- Working with 2D arrays / nested lists
- Using random seeds and random processes
- Iterating through grids and updating values
- Designing simple procedural generation logic

## How to run
Make sure Python 3 is installed, then run:

```bash
python Project3.py
```
